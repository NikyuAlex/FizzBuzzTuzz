# FizzBuzzTuzz

A didactic reimagining of the classic FizzBuzz exercise, designed to showcase problem-solving strategies and thoughtful code optimization.

## Why this project

This variant was developed not just to replicate a known logic puzzle, but to elevate it. The goal was to:

- Introduce user-controlled input and validation
- Dynamically analyze multiple divisibility conditions (by 3, 5, and 2)
- Avoid rigid `if/elif` chains and replace them with a more scalable solution
- Demonstrate mindful design in small Python scripts

This approach reflects how even basic exercises can be expanded and refined to demonstrate deeper programming understanding.

## AI-assisted process

While the core logic and structure were designed independently, I used AI assistance (ChatGPT) to:

- Validate and refactor portions of the code where repetition could be reduced
- Localize the entire script and its documentation to English
- Suggest modular design ideas and scalable alternatives (e.g., dynamic label construction)

AI was used not to write code for me, but to enhance and accelerate my workflow â€” as a supportive assistant, not a substitute.

## How to run

```bash
python fizzbuzz_tuzz_en.py
```

Tested on Python 3.7+
